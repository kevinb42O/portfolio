# Project Video Assets

This directory should contain demo videos for the project cards' hover states.

## Required Videos

To enable the hover-to-video transitions, add the following video files:

1. `unityai-demo.mp4` - UnityAI Scene Builder Tool demo
2. `diamond-hunt-demo.mp4` - Mini Diamond Hunt gameplay
3. `azeroth-demo.mp4` - Azeroth Survivors gameplay
4. `lantern-demo.mp4` - The Lantern Network features
5. `midi-demo.mp4` - MIDI Alchemy interface demo

## Video Specifications

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Duration**: 5-15 seconds (loopable)
- **Resolution**: 1280x720 or higher
- **File Size**: Keep under 5MB per video for optimal loading
- **Audio**: Muted (videos play without sound)

## Tips for Recording

- Capture smooth, representative gameplay or feature demonstrations
- Use screen recording tools like OBS, QuickTime, or built-in game capture
- Edit to show the most impressive or engaging moments
- Ensure the video loops smoothly (start and end states should match)
- Compress the video to reduce file size while maintaining quality

## Fallback Behavior

If video files are not present, the project cards will display animated gradient backgrounds based on the project's primary language color.
